Vite plugin for injecting html, js, css code snippets into index.html

## Purpose

Often, when developing front-end applications, it is necessary to integrate various libraries into the `index.html` file - for example, you might want to put there code for Google Analytics, PWA service worker, Open Graph and Twitter Card meta data, Splash screen, Customer support widget and much more.

As a result, `index.html` becomes bloated and hard to manage.

This plugin allows you to store code snippets in separate files, keeping `index.html` clean and pristine, and inject them at build time. There is no need for special placeholder tags in the `index.html` as well.

The plugin also supports `Vite dev server HMR` which means you can edit code snippets and see the result immediately in the browser.

## Description

There are three `types` of code snippets - `raw`, `js` and `css`. `raw` snippets are injected as-is, `js` and `css` ones are wrapped in `<script>` and `<style>` tags respectfully. Default `type` value is `raw`.

There are four places you can inject a code snippet to - the beginning and end of the index.html `head` tag and the beginning and end of `body`

Corresponding `injectTo` values are: `head-prepend`, `head`, `body-prepend` and `body`

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add vite-plugin-html-injection -D
```
```bash
yarn add vite-plugin-html-injection -D
```
```bash
npm i vite-plugin-html-injection -D
```

## Usage

1. Add **`vite-plugin-html-injection`** to your Vite plugins with required configuration:

```js
// vite.config.js

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { htmlInjectionPlugin } from "vite-plugin-html-injection";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    htmlInjectionPlugin({
      // transformation order - set to "pre" to use env variable replacement in html files
      // See https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#transformindexhtml
      order: "pre",
      // example injections
      injections: [
        {
          // (optional) injection name
          name: "Open Graph",
          // path to the code snippet file relative to Vite project root
          path: "./src/injections/open-graph.html",
          // (optional) code snippet type: raw | js | css
          type: "raw",
          // where to inject: head | body | head-prepend | body-prepend
          injectTo: "head",
          // (optional) which modes apply to: dev | prod | both
          buildModes: "both",
        },
        {
          name: "Google analytics",
          path: "./src/injections/ga.html",
          type: "raw",
          injectTo: "body",
          buildModes: "prod",
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

> You can place config object in a separate json file and import it in the vite.config.js

2. Create corresponding code snippets:

```html
<!-- ./src/injections/open-graph.html -->

<!-- Facebook Meta Tags -->
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.acme.com/" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:title" content="My Acme website" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Welcome to my Acme website" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://www.acme.com/logo.png" />
```

```html
<!-- ./src/injections/ga.html -->

<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-8W4X32XXXX" />
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
  gtag("js", new Date());

  gtag("config", "G-8W4X32XXXX");
</script>
```

<br>

That's it. After running `npm serve` or `npm build` command the code snippets will be injected.

<br>

## Signature

The plugin is strongly typed. Here is the signature of its configuration:

```ts
export interface IHtmlInjectionConfig {
  injections: IHtmlInjectionConfigInjection[];
  order?: "pre" | "post";
}

export interface IHtmlInjectionConfigInjection {
  name?: string;
  path: string;
  type?: "raw" | "js" | "css"; // default is 'raw'
  injectTo: "head" | "body" | "head-prepend" | "body-prepend";
  buildModes?: "dev" | "prod" | "both"; // default is 'both'
}
```
